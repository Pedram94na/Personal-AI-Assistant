Programming languages are tools used by developers to communicate with computers and create software. They come in various forms, each suited to specific tasks. High-level languages like Python and JavaScript are user-friendly and widely used for web development, automation, and data analysis. Lower-level languages like C and Assembly provide more control over hardware but are more complex to learn. Object-oriented languages, such as Java, focus on organizing code into reusable objects. Functional languages like Haskell emphasize immutability and pure functions. Many languages offer frameworks and libraries to simplify tasks. Some, like Swift and Kotlin, are designed for mobile app development. Programming languages evolve to meet modern needs, often prioritizing performance, security, or simplicity. Choosing the right one depends on the projectâ€™s goals and requirements.
